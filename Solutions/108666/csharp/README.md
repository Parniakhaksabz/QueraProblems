# About this solution

This solution has scored 100 in [Quera](https://quera.org/).

ðŸŒŸ If you like this solution, please give it a star.

##

Because we have to put all the codes in **one file**, I used the class for classification. Classes
like `Services`, `Models` are for this purpose.

Unfortunately, Quera uses the old version (probably 6) of C#, otherwise it can be written better in the new versions.
Therefore, if you like, you can refactor the codes to the new version.

## Debug Mode

For debugging convenience, you can see the output in **color**! Or if you want, you can save the output in a **file**.

For this, you need to update the `Configs` class fields.

> This class was written due to the limitations of the problem (Quera), otherwise it is not reasonable in the industry.
